# Notes

## Scope

Publications about medical education, including continuing and work-based education, and including research about people undergoing medical training (e.g. their mental health). 

1. Scientific articles (review and original) - not comments, editorials etc.
2. Medicine only, including medicine, surgery, psychiatry (not nursing, veterinary, dental, physio etc.)
3. All levels of education
    * Foundational / Undergraduate / Premed
    * Post-graduate / Residency / Junior doctor
    * Continuing / Specialist / Speciality Registrar
4. From 1991? (the last 3 decades)

## Analysis
* Consider decadal

#### Import/Export to Rayyan
We can retain the WOSID/PMID throughout the screening process by 
1. Importing to EndNote - PMID and WOSID both end up correctly in the Accession number field. In Zotero they end up in different fields.
2. Deduplicating
3. Copying Accession number field contents over to the URL field. Could theoretically do this with the doi too?
4. Import into Rayyan via RefMan (Export, txt, Refman output style)
5. Export from Rayyan using EndNote again. DOI is lost, but the URL field is retained.  

## Term notes, consider adding
* problem based learning
* work-based learning
* on the job training
* psychiatry/psychiatrist

## Example articles to test search against
Should be found
* Kristin Wigen, Are Holen & Øyvind Ellingsen (2003) Predicting academic success by group behaviour in PBL, Medical Teacher, 25:1, 32-37, DOI: 10.1080/0142159021000061396
* Gude, T., Hjortdahl, P., Anvik, T., Bærheim, A., Fasmer, O. B., Grimstad, H., ... & Vaglum, P. (2005). Does change from a traditional to a new medical curriculum reduce negative attitudes among students? A quasi-experimental study. Medical teacher, 27(8), 737-739.
* Smeby, S. S., Espeland, T., Berg, E. A. R., Samstad, E., Lillebo, B., & Slørdahl, T. S. (2021). Examining the educational impact of the mini-CEX: a randomised controlled study. BMC.

## Database choice

Using PubMed and Web of Science. Cristin can also be used back to 2011. 

In the Education database (ProQuest) you can search within author addresses using the AU field - maybe worth testing. https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/1k1ulm2/BIBSYS_ILS71554709860002201

I tried with ERIC but had the issue that you can't search within affiliations, so it is hard to limit to Norway. It seems affiliations are not indexed.
I tried using the Geographical filter but this was definately an underestimate. Thus, although ERIC would be a great database to search, I don't think we can use it without going through 10000 results manually.

## Indexing in PubMed of central journals
Coverage comment from Maggio, L.A., Costello, J.A., Norton, C. et al. Knowledge syntheses in medical education: A bibliometric analysis. Perspect Med Educ 10, 79–87 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-020-00626-9
> While all of these journals are indexed in PubMed, seven of them are not included in their entirety, namely: 
> Advances in Health Sciences Education, Canadian Medical Education Journal, Clinical Teacher, Medical Education Online, Medical Teacher, Teaching and Learning in Medicine, and The Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions. For example, Clinical Teacher first appeared in PubMed in 2010, but the journal started publishing articles in 2003. 
> Therefore, for these seven journals we identified citations from these periods by hand searching the journal’s website or Web of Science (WoS).
