# Search strategy and analysis - Medical Education

This repository contains a literature search strategy used for finding scientific publications about Medical Education research written by authors from a Norwegian institution. The search strategy is provided in markdown format in the file "Search_strategy.md" - this format allows easy copying and pasting of search strings when viewed on GitHub. It is also provided in pdf format. 

The repository also contains R code for the part of the bibliometric analysis carried out in R (file "Analysis_Rmarkdown.Rmd"). The R markdown file was written in R studio (2022.07.2) using R version 4.2.1, and can be viewed in R studio or a text editor. The analysis relies particularly on the R package Bibliometrix (Aria, M. & Cuccurullo, C. (2017) bibliometrix: An R-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis, Journal of Informetrics, 11(4), pp 959-975, Elsevier). Other packages are documented in the script.
